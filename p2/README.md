## My own notes for design process
I am building an application to help roster nurses to work. I am now focusing on the admin view first.

### Project requirements
- Auth, Users, Permissions
- SMS/Email integration
- Generate reports
- Front end Vue
- Back end Django API based on postgresQL 
- Auto allocate shifts based on past patterns
- Distinguish between weekdays/weekends/holidays (perhaps find out which days are holidays automatically)
- Clock-in/Clock-out

### Focus on the MVP
- Front end
- Admin View only
- Minimum pages: Calender View, Day View, Shift details view
- Stretch goals: Employee View

### Known bugs
Vuetify calendar components:
https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/9999

Shift accross Days will not be supported

### TODOs
Image upload
Drag and drop
Image to appear on the Calendar event.
When the data base grows, instead of retrieving all the shifts, need to filter the shifts.
